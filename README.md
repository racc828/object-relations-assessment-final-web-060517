# Object Relations Assessment

For this assignment, we'll be building out Netflix! A viewer has left many ratings on movies, and a movie has been rated by many views.

As always, make sure to sketch out your domain and think about the single source of truth for your data.

## Topics

+ Classes vs Instances
+ Variable Scope ( Class, Instance, Local )
+ Object Relationships
+ Arrays and Array Methods
+ Class Methods

## Notes

Your goal is to build out all of the methods listed in the deliverables. Do your best to follow Ruby best practices. For example, use higher-level array methods such as `map`, `select`, and `find` when appropriate in place of `each`

We've provided you with a console that you can use to test your code. To enter a console session, run `ruby tools/console.rb`. You'll be able to test out the methods that you write here.

**To Submit** - once you've completed all the deliverables, please copy/paste your three class definitions into the `solution.rb`  file. Please don't submit the lab until we give you the signal.
